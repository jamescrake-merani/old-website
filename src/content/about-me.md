Hello! My name is James Crake-Merani. I'm a sixth form student interested primarily in Computer Science, and Politics alongside other smaller interests. Here, I like to write about my various interests. I am an advocate of free (as in freedom) software. I have already run out of things to write about here so if you want to learn more about me, and my views you're probably best off having a look at my [articles]({{< ref "/articles" >}}), or if you want to find out about my tech-related views you can visit my [tech journal]({{< ref "/tech-journal" >}}).
