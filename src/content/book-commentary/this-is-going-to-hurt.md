I need to point out straight away that this book has been adapted to a television programme of the same name, and both I think are worth reading/watching but this article is primarily focused on the book. I will start with the differences between them.

The programme feels more like a dramatisation of the story that is conveyed through the book whereas the book itself is just Adam Kay's diaries, selected on the basis of what he felt to be of most interest to the reader. The programme adds stories that aren't mentioned in the book which I assume (and hope) are fictional but serve to demonstrate the enormous pressure that junior doctors, and their colleagues face. In the preface written for the new edition released after the television programme, Kay states 'is the book always better than the TV show, or does the story work better on screen? Over to you.' I suppose it's my job to decide, and in truth I don't think there is a binary option here. I feel both the programme, and book complement each other. I myself watched the programme months ago, and still saw great value in reading the book as well.

Kay employs comedy throughout his diaries, and I think comedy used in this way really conveys to the reader just how rediculous some of these situations are. Comedy removes the spin, and euphemisms to reveal the truth of the matter, and I think this is highly effective throughout the entire book. Comedy also provides a bit of light relief in between the more serious stories told.

Consistent throughout the whole book, we get a sense at just how difficult it is to be a junior doctor. You're working long hours, and are making decisions which could amount to life, or death, and there aren't many jobs like that. We also see just how damaging the job is to Kay's social life, having to frequently cancel engagements even with his own partner. One of Kay's motivations for writing the book seems to be to fight against the demonisation of junior doctors by government ministers by showing the public what is like to be a junior doctor from one. But after reading the book its effect seems to be much greater than this. As a reader, you have great sympathy for the long, and challenging hours that these doctors work. Kay remarks in his afterword that it was common for people to ask what *they* can do to help[^1]. And you really do get the impression that this situation cannot go on like this; it has to change. But the sad reality is that it probably won't. And what's dangerous is that exhausted NHS staff are bound to make mistakes which is also touched on in the book. Mistakes are worse in this sort of environment as, unfortunately, people can die as a result of them.

Another point made in the book that stood out to me is how Kay seems to feel he has been poorly prepared by medical school in dealing with the problems he faces in his job. You get a sense that he feels he's been thrown into the deep end after years of study perhaps suggesting that medical schools doesn't *really* prepare you well for the job of being a doctor.

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend reading the book but also try to watch the programme as well. It really gives you a huge appreciation to what NHS workers do under such enormous pressures, and I think for that reason alone it is worth reading. But the humour is also a welcome touch to lighten the mood in what is otherwise a very shocking read.

[^1]: If you've not read the book yet, his advice is to simply talk to people after their shifts to allow them to get their feelings out there. This is a job, after all, where traumatic events can occur frequently.
