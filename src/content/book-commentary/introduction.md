It has been ages since I last wrote anything on this website. This is partly because when I created this website I thought I could fill it with plenty of political commentary but then came to the realisation that I have very little original ideas to put here. I could just write down basic facts about the news but then I might as well work for the BBC, and I hear they've got no money.

I intend to write commentary on books I've read, spanning novels, political theories, to books about computer science. I'll only write about books I've read.

I hesitate to call these 'reviews' which is why I've gone for commentaries although I'm not sure 'book commentaries' rolls off the tongue. I am not one of these people who spends 10 years coming up with a name so this is the best you're going to get. Calling them 'reviews' implies that I am going to give the reader a good idea of the quality of the book, and perhaps a yay/nay on whether they should buy it. I am not doing this partly because I am not sure I am qualified to review books, but also because if a book is bad, I'm unlikely to finish it. If you want reviews, I'm sure you'll find plenty in the broadsheets, and magazines such as *The New Statesman*.
